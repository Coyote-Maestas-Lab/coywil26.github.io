I attempt to be transparent about my conflicts of interest. Currently, as I am writing this I am about to start as an Assistant Professor at UCSF in Bioengineering and Therapeutic sciences and have little in the way of formal conflicts of interest. However, as our research grows, I expect this to change and I will update this. If you are uncomfortable with any of these relationships please bring it up with me or those higher up in leadership at UCSF.
