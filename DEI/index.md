# Coyote-Maestas Affiliated Outreach

Throughout all stages of his training Willow Coyote-Maestas has been the direct beneficiary of support for underrepresented minorities. These experiences and Willow's identity of being mixed race (Jicarilla Apache Native descendent, Xicano, and White) has inspired Willow to be involved in many outreach activities starting in graduate

## Full Circle Native in Biology Symposium
Fluency in multiple biophysical methods is often critical for answering mechanistic questions. To train the next generation of biophysicists at UCSF, we have decided to alter the traditional didactic structure by creating a new 6 week “Macromolecular Methods” class that places data collection at the beginning of the course.

## Atlas of Variant Effect Outreach, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee
The goal for Inquiry Immersion and the interprofessional minicourses is to help first year students in the healthcare professions shift their conception of medicine as a series of facts to a vision of medical practice as consistent engagement with an ever-evolving and imperfect body of knowledge.  Focused minicourses offer students the chance to take a deep dive into a controversy or dilemma and explore the boundaries of existing research and scholarship with expert researchers.

Why is it so hard to design new small molecule drugs: Structure-based drug design promises to revolutionize drug discovery, yet despite decades of promise, progress remains intermittent. This course will give students an appreciation for the experimental and computational advances that have led to this optimism, while also pointing out the limitations that currently prevent completely unattended design.

Personal Genome Interpretation in the post-AlphaFold world: Alphafold is one of the buzziest breakthroughs of recent years. What does it mean to predict a structure of a protein and how is that useful for: 1) designing new drugs and 2) interpreting genomes?
