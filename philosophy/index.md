# Lab Philosophy

### Mission
We have built a space where we can work together to do the best science while being rigorous, having fun, and being helpful to others inside and outside the lab. Beyond doing amazing, cool science, our mission is to help train the next generation of scientists.

### Values
As a lab we value:

**open science**
•	Share data freely
•	Develop protocols which are reproducible and easily followed
•	Post preprints immediately upon submission
•	Share our plans with our scientific fields
•	Present unpublished data when possible at conferences
•	Teach others how to use our technology


**collaboration**
The big questions of science are too big for any one lab and we relish the opportunity to work with others outside of our lab to broaden our expertise and tell more satisfying and comprehensive stories. Work together as a lab while also maintaining independent projects
This approach provides opportunities to learn but also many opportunities to contribute without concern for competition between lab members. In general, aim to minimize competition as it slows down science and makes this marvelous pursuit less fun!

**rigor**
•	Avoid over interpreting data

•	Consider our work in the context of the broader scientific literature

•	Use robust statistics and collaborate with expert in areas on familiar to us

•	We consider the context of the scientific literature even if it means we are wrong

•	We follow where the data leads us and look forward to unanticipated findings


**accountability**
We try to embrace our mistakes and use them as opportunities to learn. If and when we as a lab are wrong or make mistakes, we will be immediately accountable for our actions. Willow expects lab members to be accountable for their mistakes so we can maintain an extremely high level of rigor and transparency.


**accountability**
•	The interests and well-being of lab members always before the lab

•	Allow trainees to keep their research programs when they start new labs

The needs and well-being of lab members always come before the interests of the lab. We encourage and expect lab members to enjoy and develop their personal lives and find the balance that will lead to long-term happiness and satisfaction, which contributes to a positive research environment. It is important to help people move on when it makes the most sense for their personal and professional life and at that time, it is also important that they feel they can ‘take’ their research program with them as they start independent careers.  


**Diversity**

•	Welcome folks from all backgrounds

•	Foster a supportive and diverse community of scientists within the lab

UCSF and its research labs should better resemble the communities in which it sits. Adding more diversity to our lab provides us the opportunity to have new perspectives and creative solutions to the problems we think about. We aim to build a socially and scientifically diverse team in which we can work together to tackle the hardest problems in science while growing as people as we learn about different cultures.

**Joy**
•	Having fun and taking a joyful approach to science.
We aim to have fun and take a joyful approach to science while we take on hard problems, generate beautiful data, and learn how to detangle challenging problems. If this sounds appealing and fun, come do science with us, and join our wonderful team!
