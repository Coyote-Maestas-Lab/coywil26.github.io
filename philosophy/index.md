# Lab Philosophy

### Mission
We have built a space where we can work together to do the best science while being rigorous, having fun, and being helpful to others inside and outside the lab. Beyond doing amazing, cool science, our mission is to help train the next generation of scientists.

### Values
As a lab we value **open science**, **collaboration**, **rigor**, **accountability**, **flexibility**, **diversity**, **creativity**, and **joy**.


•	Share data freely
•	Develop protocols which are reproducible and easily followed
•	Post preprints immediately upon submission
•	Share our plans with our scientific fields
•	Present unpublished data when possible at conferences
•	Teach others how to use our technology


We put our science first and while sometimes we may aim to publish in the fancy journals (you know what we are talking about), we put sharing science first, and see other lab’s concordant work as opportunities to ensure we are confident in our results and opportunities for collaboration. The big questions of science are too big for any one lab and we relish the opportunity to work with others outside of our lab to broaden our expertise and tell more satisfying and comprehensive stories.

•	Work together as a lab while also maintaining independent projects
This approach provides opportunities to learn but also many opportunities to contribute without concern for competition between lab members. In general, aim to minimize competition as it slows down science and makes this marvelous pursuit less fun!

•	Avoid over interpreting data
•	Consider our work in the context of the broader scientific literature
We apply robust statistical tests to our findings, and work with collaborators to develop holistic and rigorous stories where we test hypotheses from many angles. We consider the context of the scientific literature even if it means we are wrong.


•	Embrace our mistakes and use them as opportunities to learn
If and when we as a lab are wrong or make mistakes, we will be immediately accountable for our actions. Similarly, we expect lab members to be accountable for their mistakes so we can maintain an extremely high level of rigor and transparency. Sometimes our projects take unexpected turns or we have surprising results - these are often the best parts of science!


•	Maintain flexibility for people’s personal lives
•	Allow trainees to keep their research programs when they start new labs
The needs and well-being of lab members always come before the interests of the lab. We encourage and expect lab members to enjoy and develop their personal lives and find the balance that will lead to long-term happiness and satisfaction, which contributes to a positive research environment. It is important to help people move on when it makes the most sense for their personal and professional life and at that time, it is also important that they feel they can ‘take’ their research program with them as they start independent careers.  


•	Welcome folks from all backgrounds
•	Foster a supportive and diverse community of scientists within the lab


UCSF and its research labs should better resemble the communities in which it sits. Adding more diversity to our lab provides us the opportunity to have new perspectives and creative solutions to the problems we think about. We aim to build a socially and scientifically diverse team in which we can work together to tackle the hardest problems in science while growing as people as we learn about different cultures.

•	Having fun and taking a joyful approach to science.
Science should be filled with joy as we take on hard problems, generate beautiful data, and learn how to detangle challenging problems. If this sounds appealing and fun, come do science with us, and join our wonderful team!
