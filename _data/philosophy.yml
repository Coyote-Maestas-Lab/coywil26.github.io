  Overall, our mission is to work together to do the best science while being rigorous, having fun, and being helpful to others inside and outside the lab. We push ourselves to come up with creative solutions to challenging problems or bring new perspectives to well-studied systems. We strive to share all data we generate, make the methods we use reproducible, and teach others what we learn.
While we aim to do brilliant and cutting edge science, our mission is to also foster a supportive and welcoming lab culture where we mentor and help those who are earlier on the path. In other words beyond doing amazing, cool science, our mission is to help train the next generation of scientists. From a technical perspective, our goal is to enable entirely new types of science with our scalable approaches. Using these new technologies we will uncover fundamental principles of membrane proteins, develop holistic models across scales for how mutations and molecules impact membrane proteins from the molecular to organismal level, and addres the diseases that ail us. Overall, our goal is to do the best science we can while helping others, having fun,
and growing as people and scientists.

Diversity of previous research experiences, socioeconomic, racial, and gender backgrounds means everyone comes in with different bases of knowledge and experience. Embracing diversity means meeting people where they are at, helping them get to where they want to go, and amplifying their strengths. We center meeting mentees where they are at in my mentoring. Some people seek frequent, specific feedback, whereas others want total freedom. Willow's approach to mentorship is to tailor his interactions dependent on experience, background, and career goals. We firmly believe in accountability, self-determination, and building a supportive environment for our lab. All this together means that Willow will work with mentees to figure out what they need, how much support they want, and what steps they need to take to grow as scientists and people. We encourage developing and taking ownership of independent projects for all mentees. Willow looks forward to the day when he can help others launch their independent research careers, at which point he will let them ‘take’ their research with them. Beyond science, we encourage and expect lab members to enjoy and develop their personal lives and find the balance that will lead to long-term happiness and satisfaction, which contributes to a positive research environment.
