description: "Patrick grew up in the San Diego area, where he went to MiraCosta College before transferring to UC Santa Cruz. As an undergraduate, he worked in the lab of Shaowei Chen, studying functionalized nanoparticles and their applications in photovoltaics and nitrogen fixation. After graduating, Patrick joined the lab of Seemay Chou at UCSF, where he worked on projects seeking to understand host-pathogen interactions between ticks and Lyme Borreliae as well as structure-function studies of the bacterial cell envelope as it relates to interbacterial competition. Later, he joined the Coyote-Maestas lab, where he is developing new deep mutational scanning tools and exploring TRPV1 function through deep mutational scanning.


Outside of the lab, Patrick enjoys mountain biking and exploring the Northern California wilderness with his dog Dot.
