description: "Shirlyne graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Microbiology. During her undergraduate studies, she did research abroad at Academia Sinica with [Dr. Erh-Min Lai](https://ipmb.sinica.edu.tw/en/people/ipmb_researchers/lai-erh-min) to understand the role of E. coli proteases in modulating the DNase toxins from Type VI secretion systems in A. tumefaciens. Other research projects include developing a cell-to-cell communication platform in tobacco plants using synthetic viruses that deliver CRISPR-designed gRNAs and using EcoFABS to study microbiome interactions in B. distachyon. Currently, Shirlyne is studying how mutations can impact the assembly of NMDA receptors in the neuron, which are essential for learning and memory. These mutations can lead to insight on how various neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with the receptor function.

Outside of lab, Shirlyne likes to explore new hiking trails, develop her food politics blog, and grab coffee with friends."
