description: "Mattâ€™s research focuses on developing and using mutational scanning platforms to study
GPCR biology with the goal of generating holistic models for how receptors work at the
protein level, and how perturbations propagate across cell biology and physiology.
Prior to UCSF, Matt graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with degrees in
chemistry and biology. At WashU, Matt worked in the Jackrel Lab studying structure-
function relationships in the disaggregase Hsp104 and strategies for disrupting biofilm-
associated amyloids."
