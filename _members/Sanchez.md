description: "Rosa Sanchez received her bachelorâ€™s degree in Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. As an undergraduate student, she worked in a Biochemistry and Chemistry Lab, under [Michael Stone](https://stone.chemistry.ucsc.edu). Here, she learned about the telomeres and telomerase. One of her favorite parts was learning about shelterin proteins and purifying them!


Rosa really enjoys going on long walks, conversations over a cup of tea, and watching comedy. Her favorite foods are pozole and tacos."
