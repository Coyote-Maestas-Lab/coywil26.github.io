# Join the Coyote-Maestas Lab!
Our lab welcomes applicants regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or family commitments. We strike to maintain a supportive and collaborative culture where we support each other through thick and thin, grow as scientists, have fun, and do the coolest science we can!

We are actively looking for motivated and talented people to join our team! We would love to hear about your scientific background, long term goals and how we may work together to get you there. If interested please send your CV to [Dr. Willow Coyote-Maestas](/contact).

<!-- Currently we have **open positions** for people with the following skills:
[Specialist](https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/JPF03325) who will engage in research projects and also manage daily wet lab operations. -->

## Graduate Students

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/programs) and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate in ~3 labs before deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is usually open for rotation students every quarter and will generally have room for 1-3 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year.

During a rotation you will have regular meetings with Willow and your lab mentor. The goal of a rotation is for you to get to know our lab's culture, an understanding of what excites us, and discover whether we are a good. At the end of the rotation you will be expected to give a talk summarizing your success, meet 1-on-1 with Willow to debrief the experience, and teach us how we could have supported you more. If the experience was positive for everyone we will have a follow-up discussion at the end of spring quarter. Because we are a member of multiple graduate programs with different policies and timings for final lab decision making, we cannot make any final commitments until the end of the Spring Quarter to ensure all rotations students are given consideration.

##### The Coyote-Maestas Lab thus far participates in the following UCSF graduate programs:
  * **[Biophysics](http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/)**
  * **[Tetrad](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)**
  * **[Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://ccb.ucsf.edu/)**
  * **[Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics](http://pspg.ucsf.edu/)**

## Postdoctoral Fellows
We are always looking for motivated and brilliant postdocs. If you are potentially interested reach out directly to  [Dr. Willow Coyote-Maestas](/contact). We set our postdoctoral fellow compensation to the [Stanford rates](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/funding-levels-and-guidelines) **and** will work with candidates to apply for relevant fellowships to fund your research.

## Visitors
Our lab is highly collaborative and enjoys training others in our technologies. We look forward to hosting academic or industry visitors and postbac research specialists in the lab. We are open to other arrangements as well, just reach out and we can figure out an arrangement that works for all of us.
