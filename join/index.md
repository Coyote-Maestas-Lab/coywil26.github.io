# Join the Coyote-Maestas Lab!
Our lab welcomes applicants regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or family commitments. We strike to maintain a supportive and collaborative culture where we support each other through thick and thin.

We are actively looking for motivated and talented people to join our team! We would love to hear about your scientific background, long term goals and how we may work together to get you there. If interested please send your CV to [Dr. Coyote-Maestas](/contact).

<!-- Currently we have **open positions** for people with the following skills:
[Specialist](https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/JPF03325) who will engage in research projects and also manage daily wet lab operations. -->

## Graduate Students

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/programs) and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate in ~3 labs before deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is usually open for rotation students every quarter and will generally have room for 1-3 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year.

During a rotation you will have regular meetings with Willow and your lab mentor. The goal of a rotation is for you to get to know our lab's culture, an understanding of what excites us, and discover whether we are a good. At the end of the rotation you will be expected to give a talk summarizing your success and meet 1-on-1 with Willow to debrief the experience. If the experience was positive for everyone we will have a follow-up discussion at the end of Spring Quarter. Because we are a member of multiple graduate programs with different policies and timings for final lab decision making, we cannot make any final commitments until the end of the Spring Quarter to ensure all rotations students are given consideration.

##### The Coyote-Maestas Lab thus far participates in the following UCSF graduate programs:
  * **[Biophysics](http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/)**: The Biophysics Graduate Program (BP) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to leverage new and emerging research tools—from nanotechnology to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy—to quantify biological processes in living biological systems using physics and chemistry.
  * **[Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://ccb.ucsf.edu/)**: The Chemistry and Chemical Biology Graduate Program (CCB) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to address problems at the intersection of chemistry and biology by providing a chemical foundation for understanding complex biological processes at an atomic level.
  * **[Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics](http://pspg.ucsf.edu/)**: The Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics (PSPG) Graduate Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) focuses on how to develop effective drug therapies for patients that have a minimum of adverse effects.
  * **[Tetrad](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)**: The Tetrad graduate program offers diverse training in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, & Genetics.
  * If your program is not listed here, please reach out to Willow and we will see if are a good fit. There are relatively few barriers for faculty to join graduate programs, if we decide a rotation makes sense.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Dr. Willow Coyote-Maestas](/contact). We set our postdoctoral fellow compensation to the [Stanford rates](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/funding-levels-and-guidelines) **and** encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Visitors

Our lab is highly collaborative and enjoys training others in our technologies. We are open to having academic or industry visitors and postbac research specialists in the lab. We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available.
