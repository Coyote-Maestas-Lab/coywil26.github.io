![What we do!](static/img/logo/front_page.png){:style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"}

Our research focuses on building biophysical, molecular, and cellular understandings of the secret life of membrane proteins.  We build and apply scalable technologies to learn how membrane proteins underlie our physiology, what goes awry in disease, and how to better treat these diseases with therapeutics.

We are located in Byers Hall on the Mission Bay Campus of UCSF.
